function [] = pmAutoThresh(ff,OutputFolder)
%Define pmAutoThresh() function that will automatically threshold and
%image file with the method of users choice
%Steps-
%   1. Parse File path input and if single image or stack
%   2. Read in image data
%   3. Apply automatic thresholding method set by option flags
%   4. Write thresholded data to mask file?
%
%Input:
%Full file path to image file to threshold
%Default input
% ff = 'fullfile(filePath,fileName,fileExtension)'
% OutputFolder = Path to output folder
% Options flags for thresholding method selection
