function [] = pmBioFormats(ff,OutputFolder)
%Define pmBioFormats() function that uses Bio-Formats Java library to import
%many types of microscopy image formats and convert them to standard
%supported file formats
%Steps-
%   -2. Check for Bio-Formats is the newest version? bfUpgradeCheck.m, only on 1st
%   run?
%   -1. Check if java class path set correctly for Bio-Formats with
%   bfCheckJavaPath.m. NOT REQUIRED as bf functions will do this already.
%   0. Check Matlab JVM memory is sufficient with bfCheckJavaMemory.m, 
%   only once per run?  This may not be required, as bfopen.m calls
%   bfGetReader.m which calls bfCheckJavaMemory.m, BUT memory may need to 
%   be reset to a higher value by writing default memory size to java.opts 
%   file, and printing message to user with info?
%   1. Parse File path input and if single image or stack
%   2. Use bfGetReader.m to read single image data or bfGetPlane.m with
%   loop for image stack
%   3. Write image data to output file
%   ?4. Use bfopen.m or bfOpen3DVolume.m OR converted data to display
%   converted image file(s)
%   ?Add Functionality to allow bfInitLogging('DEBUG') to be set for
%   troubleshooting perhaps with commented out lines or debug flag?

%Input:
